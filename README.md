# vueapp
Start by installing the Vue CLI.
npm instalar -g @vue/cli.
Next, you need to navigate to the folder where you want to create the application on the command line and run the following command:
vue create vueapp
vueapp is the name of my project.
npm run serve.
The application starts at http://localhost:8080/ by default.
I have created a simple Vue.js application with fetching data from API. To create an app I use Vue CLI, axios for the API call and Bootstrap for the styling. As a result, I got an application with a list of users in a table.
